"WEP" - Water Electric Protocol

1) If you seen "Invaild" data within a ruleset defined, it crashes
2) if it crashes X times within X Seconds PLC IS DEAD
3) Randomly drops packets. All coms should receive a response, if its invaild, send it again!
4) MASTER KEY FOR CHKSUM [5,7,2,7,14,14,12,15,7,7,12,8,0,6,1,10,10,13,1,6,15,13,11,11,11,5,1,12,4,12,3,1,5,9,11,6,15,15,12,8,15,8,13,0,0,14,2,8,2]

-STX (3 1s)
START BIT ACTION	1 bit is this message requesting data or state from port, 1 will be to read, and 0 to set
-PARITY
PORT				PORT NUMBER TO POLL 4 bits, every port will have a state that can be read, if a sensor is written to, its a failure or nop

-PARITY
ACTION				Action value will be gate hight 4 bits, open close (like 0 is close and 15 is open, flip logic randomly of course)
